While it might be tempting to keep patching up your old unit, you\u2019ll likely find yourself facing a losing battle against time.

Furthermore, many components are no longer under warranty, leaving you to shoulder the cost of any replacements."

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), once commonly used in air conditioners, have been phased out due to their harmful effects on the ozone layer. As a result, it is now illegal to manufacture, use, sell, or import these substances."

For example, if your system develops a refrigerant leak or needs a recharge, you\u2019ll be unable to obtain the necessary replacement refrigerant. In this case, upgrading to a new, environmentally-friendly AC system that uses approved refrigerants is the only viable option."
