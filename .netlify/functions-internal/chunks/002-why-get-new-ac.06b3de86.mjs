If your AC unit has been around for a while, it might be time to consider a replacement. There are numerous benefits to upgrading your air conditioning system, from increased energy efficiency to compliance with environmental regulations. In this blog post, we'll dive into the top four reasons why you should replace your AC this summer.\n\n## 1. Embrace the Power of Energy Efficiency\n\nOne of the most compelling reasons to invest in a new AC system is the improved energy efficiency that modern units offer. With each passing year, advancements in technology and design have led to AC systems that consume less energy while providing quicker cooling times, more stable room temperatures, and reduced noise levels.\n\nImagine lounging in your home on a sweltering summer day, enjoying the quiet hum of your new AC as it effortlessly cools your living space. Not only will you be more comfortable, but you'll also save money on your power billâ€”an attractive prospect for any budget-conscious homeowner.\n\n## 2. Dodge the Pitfalls of Aging AC Systems\n\nAs your AC system ages, it becomes more prone to breakdowns and malfunctions. While it might be tempting to keep patching up your old unit, you'll likely find yourself facing a losing battle against time. Replacement parts for older AC systems are becoming increasingly scarce, making repairs both more challenging and more expensive. Furthermore, many components are no longer under warranty, leaving you to shoulder the cost of any replacements.\n\nAdditionally, outdated AC technology can lead to less efficient cooling and an increased likelihood of breakdowns. By upgrading to a newer system, you're not only ensuring easier access to readily available parts and up-to-date technology but also investing in the longevity and reliability of your AC system.\n\n\n## 3. Stay Compliant with Environmental Regulations\nIn recent years, Canada has implemented strict regulations to protect the environment, particularly concerning the refrigerants used in older AC systems. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), once commonly used in air conditioners, have been phased out due to their harmful effects on the ozone layer. As a result, it is now illegal to manufacture, use, sell, or import these substances.\n\nIf your current AC system still relies on outdated refrigerants, you may find yourself in a bind if your unit requires maintenance or repairs involving these substances. For example, if your system develops a refrigerant leak or needs a recharge, you'll be unable to obtain the necessary replacement refrigerant. In this case, upgrading to a new, environmentally-friendly AC system that uses approved refrigerants is the only viable option.\n\n## 4. Beat the Summer Rush and Ensure a Smooth Installation Process\nMany homeowners in Saskatoon don't use their AC systems until the hottest months of the year, typically June through August. As such, AC-related issues often don't come to light until this period, which also happens to be the busiest time for HVAC contractors and suppliers. This increased demand can lead to longer wait times for new AC units, particularly if you're sourcing your system from the United States or Mexico.\n\nBy being proactive and replacing your AC system before the peak summer season, you'll avoid the inconvenience of long wait times and ensure a smooth installation process. Plus, you'll be able to enjoy the full benefits of your new AC system as soon as the summer heat arrives.\n\n---\n\n## Choose Us for Your AC Replacement Needs\n\nWhen it comes to replacing your air conditioning system, you can trust our team of experienced technicians to provide professional service and quality workmanship.
